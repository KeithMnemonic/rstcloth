Huge thankyou to Sam Kleiderman (@tychoish) who originated this package and maintained it up to v0.2.6


.. _version_0.0.x:

Up To 0.2.6
===========

Versions up to 0.2.6 were maintained by @tychoish


0.3.0 Onward
============

@thclark took over project, merged outstanding PRs from over the years, tidied up, sorted docs and devops, made tox
tests run, updated dependencies and refactored lots. @mateja contributed a lot of functionality like additional directives,
performance enhancements and fixes.

..ATTENTION::

   This library is pretty stable, but I'm not quite ready to do a 1.0.0 release.
   Pin your versions, people! We use semver which is commonly misunderstood:
   breaking changes CAN occur between `0.x` and `0.x+1`.
   This is why you pin to `^0.5.1`, which is shorthand for `>=0.5.1,<0.6`.


.. _releases:

Releases
========

We create release notes automatically using
octue's `conventional commits tools <https://github/octue/conventional-commits>`_
for completely automating code versions, release numbering and release history.

So for a full version history, check our `releases page <https://github.com/thclark/rstcloth/releases>`_.
